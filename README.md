# 2048-Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can slide numbered tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) to merge matching tiles and reach the 2048 tile. The game keeps track of the player's score and ends when no more moves are possible.
